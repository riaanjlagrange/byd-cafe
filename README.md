# BYD - Brew Your Day Cafe

Assignment for WE22 Module. Brew your day is a cafe website and allows you to book reservation for workpaces, attend live events and most importantly, enjoy the best coffee in Bellville! NB! This is just a design and features like booking does not actually do anything. Also I'm using Render free plan for deployment, which puts the website in idle mode until someone visits it. So If it doesn't load, just wait a while and refresh.
